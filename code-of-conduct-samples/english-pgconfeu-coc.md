# Code of Conduct

PGConf.EU 20XX is dedicated to providing a safe, harassment-free, and enjoyable conference experience for everyone. Please be helpful, considerate, friendly, and respectful towards all other participants and venue staff.

We do not tolerate harassment of PGConf.EU 20XX participants or venue staff in any form. Imagery and language which promotes, supports, glorifies, or encourages acts of violence, harassment of any form, sexism or sexual misconduct, or hate speech, is not appropriate for any conference venue, including exhibition booths, talks, and social events around PGConf.EU 20XX. Conference participants violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from the conference without a refund at the discretion of the PGConf.EU 20XX conference organizers.

Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion, political stance, origin, displaying sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention. Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.

If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the PGConf.EU 2024 conference organizers may take any action they deem appropriate, including ejection from the conference with no refund. If you feel that you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please do not hesitate to immediately use one of the contact options listed below.

PGConf.EU 20XX volunteers will be happy to help participants contact hotel/venue security or the police, provide escorts, or otherwise assist those experiencing harassment to feel safe for the duration of the conference. The registration desk is staffed and ready to assist anyone at all times during the event.

Thank you for your help in making PGConf.EU 20XX fun and enjoyable for everyone!
