# Code of Conduct

In order to keep FOSDEM a fun, interesting, and positive experience for everybody, we expect participants to follow our guidelines:

FOSDEM aims to be a free, open, and cooperative event. This means we expect collaboration from all the FOSDEM participants, and for everybody to behave respectfully towards all others, including those that are different or think differently from themselves.

Please be helpful, considerate, friendly, and respectful towards all other participants and respect the environment. We don't condone harassment or offensive behaviour at our conference. We consider it against our values as human beings. We're voicing our strong, unequivocal support of exemplary behaviour by all participants.

Please remember that all FOSDEM participants are here by invitation of the conference organisers and the ULB. We expect all participants to follow this Code of Conduct during the conference and related events. This includes conference-related social events at off-site locations, and in related online communities and on social media. Participants asked to stop a particular behaviour by staff are expected to comply immediately. Conference participants violating this Code of Conduct may be expelled from the conference and/or banned from formal participation in future events.

Please bring any concerns to the immediate attention of our coordinating team (contact details below).

Thank you for your help in making FOSDEM a success and pleasant for all the people involved.
