# Contributing Guide

## Fork the Repository

To start contributing, first fork the repository:



1. Navigate to the GitHub repository you want to contribute to.
2. Click on the "Fork" button at the top right corner of the repository page.
3. This will create a copy of the repository under your GitHub account, allowing you to make changes without affecting the original project.

## Create a New Branch

After forking the repository, create a new branch for your changes:

1. Clone the forked repository to your local machine:

    `git clone https://github.com/your-username/repository-name.git`

2. Navigate into the cloned directory:

    `cd repository-name`

3. Create a new branch with a descriptive name:

    `git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name`

Replace your-feature-name with a name that describes your changes, such as fix-typo or add-new-feature.    

## Make Your Changes and Commit Them

Now that you have a new branch, you can make the necessary changes:

1. Implement your changes or additions to the codebase.
2. Once you've made your changes, stage them for commit:

   `git add .`

3. Commit your changes with a clear and descriptive commit message:

   `git commit -m "Description of the changes you made"`

## Submit a Pull Request
To contribute your changes back to the original repository:

1. Push your branch to your forked repository on GitHub:

   `git push origin feature/your-feature-name`

2. Navigate to the original repository on GitHub.
3. Click on the "Compare & pull request" button next to your branch.
4. Provide a clear title and description for your pull request, explaining what changes you made and why.
5. Submit the pull request for review.
